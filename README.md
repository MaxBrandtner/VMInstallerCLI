# VMInstallerCLI

THIS AN EARLY ALPHA WITHOUT ALL FEATURES IMPLEMENTED YET. THERE ARE BUGS / ISSUES. I AM CURRENLY REFACTORING THIS CODE FOR BETTER SCALABILITY / MAINTAINABILITY. THIS PROJECT WILL SOON BE SPLIT INTO A BACKEND AND A FRONTEND PROJECT, MEANING THAT THIS REPOSITORY WILL SOON REACH END OF LIFE. THIS IS A WIP WHICH DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY YET: THE FOLLOWING DOES NOT WORK YET

## Introduction

VMInstallerCLI is a GUI application that is capable of setting up type-one-hypervisor VM, without the user having to write scripts, configure grub, xml edits, ...

It's goal is to make it as easy and as quick as possible to set up a VM

CURRENTLY ONLY WORKS UNDER A LIMITED AMOUNT OF CONDITIONS. I HAVE NOT ADJUSTED FOR PEOPLE THAT USE A DISPLAY MANAGER OTHER THAN GDM, SDDM, or lightDM. PASSING THROUGH INTEGRATED GRAPHICS PROCESSORS MAY NOT WORK.
